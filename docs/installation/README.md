# Installation

Drive v1 is **Docker-first** for self-hosting on a single machine (Compose
baseline).

Start here:

- `docs/selfhost/README.md`

Runbooks:

- `docs/installation/backup-restore.md`
- `docs/selfhost/upgrade.md`
- `docs/selfhost/rollback.md`

## Kubernetes (reference-only)

Kubernetes/Helm documentation and manifests remain available **as-is** as
reference material. They are not the v1 baseline and are not hardened as part of
the v1 scope.

See:

- `docs/installation/kubernetes.md`
