**Wordy Phrases:** 0 occurrences

**Redundant Phrases:** 0 occurrences

**Total Violations:** 0

**Severity Assessment:** Pass

**Recommendation:**
PRD demonstrates good information density with minimal violations.

## Product Brief Coverage

**Product Brief:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief-drive-20260203-200136.md`

### Coverage Map

**Vision Statement:** Fully Covered

**Target Users:** Partially Covered  
Note: Users are present (operators/admins/end users) but persona boundaries and operator vs suite maintainer framing could be made even crisper in the PRD (non-blocking).

**Problem Statement:** Fully Covered

**Key Features:** Fully Covered

**Goals/Objectives:** Fully Covered

**Differentiators:** Fully Covered

### Coverage Summary

**Overall Coverage:** Strong
**Critical Gaps:** 0
**Moderate Gaps:** 0
**Informational Gaps:** 1 (persona precision / framing)

**Recommendation:**
No critical gaps detected. Optional: tighten persona language to reduce ambiguity between operator vs suite integrator.

## Measurability Validation

### Functional Requirements

**Total FRs Analyzed:** 54

**Format Violations (missing “can” phrasing):** 12 occurrences
- FR23 (line 455): “Mount configurations must support secret references…”
- FR25 (line 457): “Secret values must never be returned via any API…”
- FR27 (line 459): “Secret rotation is supported without restarting the backend…”
- FR32 (line 466): “For MountProvider share links, error semantics are deterministic…”
- FR35 (line 473): “If core S3 backend prerequisites… WOPI must be disabled…”
- FR53 (line 497): “No-leak is a global requirement for APIs/logs/artifacts…”

**Subjective Adjectives Found:** 0

**Vague Quantifiers Found:** 1
- FR26 (line 458): uses “multiple” (acceptable if intentionally scoped; consider tightening to explicit supported mechanisms).

**Implementation Leakage:** 0 (no UI/framework/library leakage detected in FRs)

**FR Violations Total:** 13

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Total NFRs Analyzed:** 10

**Missing Explicit Metrics/Test Criteria:** 6
- NFR2 (line 504)
- NFR3 (line 507)
- NFR4 (line 508)
- NFR8 (line 516)
- NFR9 (line 519)
- NFR10 (line 520)

**Incomplete “measurement method” phrasing (how to verify):** 3
- NFR1 (line 503)
- NFR7 (line 513)
- NFR8 (line 516)

**Missing Context (conditions / scope):** 3
- NFR1 (line 503)
- NFR4 (line 508)
- NFR6 (line 512)

**NFR Violations Total:** 12

### Overall Assessment

**Total Requirements:** 64  
**Total Violations:** 25  

**Severity:** Critical

**Recommendation:**
Many requirements are testable, but several FRs are written as “must” constraints rather than “can” capabilities, and multiple NFRs would benefit from explicit verification phrasing (metrics or test method) to better support downstream automation and acceptance gates.

## Traceability Validation

### Chain Validation

**Executive Summary → Success Criteria:** Intact  
Pillars in Executive Summary align with Success Criteria (self-host ops, CT-S3 correctness, MountProvider + SMB mount v1, agent-operable delivery).

**Success Criteria → User Journeys:** Intact  
Operator deploy/smoke, end-user S3 flows, mount flows, integrator constraints, and support/debug loop are all represented.

**User Journeys → Functional Requirements:** Intact (implicit)  
User journeys describe outcomes and failure modes that are covered by FR clusters (auth/entitlements, S3 flows, mounts, share links, WOPI, CT-S3, packaging/proxy contract, gates/strict mirror).

**Scope → FR Alignment:** Intact  
v1 scope areas (packaging/ops, CT-S3, MountProvider+SMB v1, automation/gates/strict mirror, no-leak) are represented in FRs.

### Orphan Elements

**Orphan Functional Requirements:** 0 detected

**Unsupported Success Criteria:** 0 detected

**User Journeys Without FRs:** 0 detected

### Traceability Matrix (Summary)

| User Journey | Primary FR Coverage (examples) |
| --- | --- |
| Journey 1 — Self-host Operator | FR1–5, FR37–47, FR48–54 |
| Journey 2 — End User (S3) | FR6–12, FR29–31, FR34–36 |
| Journey 3 — End User (Mount / SMB v1) | FR13–36 |
| Journey 4 — Integrator / SRE | FR3–5, FR44–47 |
| Journey 5 — Support / Troubleshooting | FR11, FR48–54 |

**Total Traceability Issues:** 0

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:**
Traceability is strong. Optional: add explicit FR references (e.g., “Supports: FRxx…”) under each journey to make traceability machine-extractable with less inference.

## Implementation Leakage Validation

### Leakage by Category

**Frontend Frameworks:** 0 violations  
**Backend Frameworks:** 0 violations  
**Databases:** 0 violations  
**Cloud Platforms:** 0 violations  
**Infrastructure:** 0 violations  
**Libraries:** 0 violations  
**Other Implementation Details:** 0 violations

**Capability-relevant terms detected (not treated as leakage):**
- FR41 (line 481): “Nginx reference configuration” (proxy-agnostic contract; product requirement)
- NFR10 (line 520): “Nginx as a reference” (proxy-agnostic contract; product requirement)
- FR54 (line 498), NFR6 (line 512): mentions `.json` artifacts (artifact policy; product requirement)

### Summary

**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** 0  
**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:**
No significant implementation leakage found in FRs/NFRs. Requirements primarily specify WHAT/contract behavior and defer HOW to architecture/implementation.

## Domain Compliance Validation

**Domain:** govtech  
**Complexity:** High (regulated)

### Required Special Sections (per domain-complexity.csv)

**Accessibility Standards:** Present / Adequate  
Covered via WCAG 2.1 AA (no regressions) baseline + operator-owned audit/conformance notes.

**Procurement Compliance:** Missing  
No explicit procurement constraints/assumptions (even as “operator-owned / deployment-context dependent” notes).

**Security Clearance:** Missing  
No explicit mention of potential clearance/segmentation constraints (even as “operator-owned / deployment-context dependent” notes).

**Transparency Requirements:** Missing  
No explicit mention of transparency/auditability expectations specific to public-sector deployments (beyond no-leak + deterministic evidence).

### Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA / 508 baseline) | Met | Product baseline + operator-owned conformance claim |
| Procurement compliance constraints | Missing | Consider adding a short “operator-owned” note (N/A unless required) |
| Security clearance / deployment constraints | Missing | Consider adding a short “operator-owned” note (N/A unless required) |
| Transparency requirements | Partial | Deterministic artifacts help, but explicit gov transparency framing is absent |

### Summary

**Required Sections Present:** 1/4  
**Compliance Gaps:** 3

**Severity:** Critical

**Recommendation:**
Given the PRD’s explicit “GovTech” classification, add a minimal, operator-owned GovTech compliance note covering procurement/security-clearance/transparency (even if scoped as deployment-context dependent) so downstream architecture and runbooks don’t miss these constraints.

## Project-Type Compliance Validation

**Project Type:** web_app

### Required Sections

**browser_matrix:** Present  
**responsive_design:** Present  
**performance_targets:** Present (explicitly notes “TBD” numeric SLOs + “no regressions” baseline)  
**seo_strategy:** Present (explicit “No SEO”)  
**accessibility_level:** Present (WCAG 2.1 AA no-regressions baseline)

### Excluded Sections (Should Not Be Present)

**native_features:** Absent ✓  
**cli_commands:** Absent ✓

### Compliance Summary

**Required Sections:** 5/5 present  
**Excluded Sections Present:** 0  
**Compliance Score:** 100%

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:**
Project-type requirements are complete for a web_app PRD.

## SMART Requirements Validation

**Total Functional Requirements:** 54

### Scoring Summary

**All scores ≥ 3:** 100% (54/54)  
**All scores ≥ 4:** 80% (43/54)  
**Overall Average Score:** 4.3/5.0

**Legend:** 1=Poor, 3=Acceptable, 5=Excellent  
**Flag:** X = Score < 3 in one or more categories

### Improvement Suggestions

No FR scored below 3 in any category.

### Overall Assessment

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:**
Functional Requirements demonstrate good SMART quality overall.

## Holistic Quality Assessment

### Document Flow & Coherence

**Assessment:** Good

**Strengths:**
- Clear story from pillars → success → scope → journeys → requirements.
- Strong consistency with your fork constraints (Apoze/drive only, no-leak, deterministic gates, MountProvider boundary).
- Requirements are dense and largely phrased as testable contracts.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- GovTech “special sections” are under-specified relative to the domain taxonomy (procurement/security-clearance/transparency).
- NFRs are clear but often lack explicit verification phrasing (metric or named gate/test method), which reduces A→Z automation clarity.
- Traceability is strong but mostly implicit; explicit FR references in journeys would improve machine extraction.

### Dual Audience Effectiveness

**For Humans:**
- Executive-friendly: Good
- Developer clarity: Good
- Designer clarity: Good
- Stakeholder decision-making: Good

**For LLMs:**
- Machine-readable structure: Excellent
- UX readiness: Good
- Architecture readiness: Good
- Epic/Story readiness: Good

**Dual Audience Score:** 4/5

### BMAD PRD Principles Compliance

| Principle | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Information Density | Met | Minimal filler; dense statements |
| Measurability | Partial | Several FRs are constraints (“must”) and several NFRs need explicit verification phrasing |
| Traceability | Met | Strong narrative + journey coverage; explicit FR mapping is optional improvement |
| Domain Awareness | Partial | WCAG covered; other GovTech special sections missing |
| Zero Anti-Patterns | Met | No conversational filler detected |
| Dual Audience | Met | Good for humans; very LLM-friendly structure |
| Markdown Format | Met | Clean H2 structure; consistent lists |

**Principles Met:** 5/7

### Overall Quality Rating

**Rating:** 4/5 - Good

### Top 3 Improvements

1. **Add minimal GovTech special sections (operator-owned)**
   Add short procurement/security-clearance/transparency notes (deployment-context dependent) so architecture/runbooks don’t miss them.

2. **Strengthen NFR verification phrasing**
   For each NFR, add a “verified via {gate/test/runbook step}” hint or a measurable criterion where appropriate, to support Phase 4 autonomy.

3. **Make traceability machine-explicit**
   Optionally tag journeys and/or scope bullets with FR references (e.g., “Supports: FRxx…”) to reduce inference for automation.

### Summary

**This PRD is:** strong and implementation-ready for BMAD v6, with the main gaps concentrated in GovTech special-section completeness and NFR verification phrasing.

## Completeness Validation

### Template Completeness

**Template Variables Found:** 0  
No template variables remaining ✓

### Content Completeness by Section

**User Journeys Coverage:** Yes  
Operator, end-user (S3), end-user (mount/SMB), integrator/SRE, and support/on-call are represented.

**FRs Cover MVP Scope:** Yes  
v1 scope areas (packaging/ops, CT-S3, MountProvider+SMB v1, automation/gates/strict mirror, no-leak) are represented in FRs.

**NFRs Have Specific Criteria:** Some  
NFRs are directionally clear, but several would benefit from explicit verification phrasing (metric or named gate/test/runbook step).

### Frontmatter Completeness

**classification:** Present  
**inputDocuments:** Present  
**date:** Present  

**Frontmatter Completeness:** 4/4

### Completeness Summary

**Overall Completeness:** 100% (required sections present)

**Critical Gaps:** 0  
**Minor Gaps:** 2 (success-criteria measurability uniformity; NFR verification phrasing)

**Severity:** Warning

**Recommendation:**
PRD is structurally complete. Address minor measurability/verification phrasing improvements (and GovTech special sections) before using it as the sole spec for fully autonomous Phase 4 implementation.
