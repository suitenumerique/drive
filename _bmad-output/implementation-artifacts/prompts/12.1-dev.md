# Codex Dev Prompt — Story 12.1 (Gates runner)

Source of truth:
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/12-1-gates-runner-executes-stable-gate-ids-and-writes-deterministic-artifacts.md`

Goal:
- Implement a deterministic gates runner keyed by stable `gate_id`.
- Write deterministic artifacts under `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`.
- Failures must include stable `failure_class` + `next_action_hint` (no-leak).

Notes:
- Keep ordering stable and outputs deterministic (no timestamps inside JSON/text content).

Verification:
- `make lint`
- Add/adjust backend tests if appropriate and run `make test-back` (or targeted tests).

Traceability:
- Run folder `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/runs/<ts>-12.1/` + update `latest.txt` + `sprint-status.yaml` + Dev Agent Record.
