# Orchestrator runs

Orchestrator runs typically include:

- `dry-run.plan.txt`
- `summary.txt`

> Note: this is a historical experiment for a “one-shot” loop and is not used anymore.
> Run checks directly via Make targets (`make lint`, `make test-back`, etc.).

## Runs

- (removed) Individual run folders were deleted during cleanup because they referenced deprecated scripts.

## Navigation

- Up: [Implementation artifacts](../index.md)
- Root: [_bmad-output index](../../index.md)
